BERT is an open-source machine learning framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP). BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Language Representations from Transformers) helps computers understand the meaning of ambiguous language in text by using surrounding text to establish context. BERT is pre-trained on two different but related NLP techniques

•	Masked Language Model (MLM) where a word in a sentence is hidden and the program must predict it based on its context

•	Next Sentence Prediction is to have the program predict whether the two given sentences have a logical, sequential, connection or their relationship is simply random
